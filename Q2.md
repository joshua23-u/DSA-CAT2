Differences Between Arrays and Linked Lists

1. Memory Allocation

Arrays: Use contiguous memory allocation. The storage placement of all elements occurs in one continuous memory segment. A fixed size exists from the moment arrays are declared.

int[] arr = new int[5];

The memory allocation in Linked Lists functions dynamically. Each element (node) contains node data and a reference to the following element within the series. Memory is allocated as needed.

class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;
    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
