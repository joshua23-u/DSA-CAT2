Differences Between Arrays and Linked Lists
1. Memory Allocation
Arrays: Use contiguous memory allocation. The storage placement of all elements occurs in one continuous memory segment. A fixed size exists from the moment arrays are declared.
int[] arr = new int[5];
The memory allocation in Linked Lists functions dynamically. Each element (node) contains node data and a reference to the following element within the series. Memory is allocated as needed.
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;
    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
2. Performance
Arrays allow O(1) speed in retrieving data with indices yet require slow shifting operations during middle insertions and deletions.
The performance of linked lists for accessing data remains at O(n) speed due to traversal requirements although their begin operations such as insertion and deletion occur at O(1) status.
3. Insertion and Deletion Operations
Insertion
A mid-point array element insertion requires shifting every quality element which exists after the desired insertion position.
int[] arr = {1, 2, 4, 5};
The operation inserts 3 at index position 2 by moving all following elements to the right.
Adding elements to Linked Lists involves easy operations because updating pointers functions without requiring element movement.
newNode.next = prevNode.next;
prevNode.next = newNode;
Deletion
The procedure of erasing elements positioned in the array middle section needs elements to move from their original positions toward the left.
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
// Remove arr[2] (shift elements left)
The deletion operations on Linked Lists require pointer adjustments to complete them.
prevNode.next = prevNode.next.next;
Conclusion
Establishe Arrays to handle situations that need many quick data access operations.
Linked Lists provide the best solution for operations that include many insertions and deletions.
