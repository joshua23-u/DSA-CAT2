  Big O Notation in Algorithm Analysis
Algorithms use Big O notation to evaluate their operating speed through measurements of both time complexity and space requirements. The usage of Big O notation enables users to observe performance modifications when input size expands. The fundamental principles which define Big O notation consist of the following:
 1. Ignore Constant Factors
Under Big O analysis the dominant terms take precedence since constant values affect execution time at nearly the same rate.
Example:
Since we ignore constants during big O analysis the term \(O(2n)\) reduces to \(O(n)\).
2. Different Growth Rates

Different Big O classifications indicate different performance:

O(1) - Constant Time: Execution time is independent of input size.

int getFirstElement(int[] arr) {
    return arr[0]; // Always takes the same time
}

O(n) - Linear Time: Execution time increases proportionally to input size.

void printElements(int[] arr) {
    for (int num : arr) {
        System.out.println(num);
    }
}

O(nÂ²) - Quadratic Time: Execution time grows as the square of input size.

void printPairs(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
            System.out.println(arr[i] + ", " + arr[j]);
        }
    }
}

O(log n) - Logarithmic Time: Execution time grows slowly as input increases.
int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) return mid;
        else if (arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
        else right = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
