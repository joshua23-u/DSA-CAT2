  Big O Notation in Algorithm Analysis

Algorithms use Big O notation to evaluate their operating speed through measurements of both time complexity and space requirements. The usage of Big O notation enables users to observe performance modifications when input size expands. The fundamental principles which define Big O notation consist of the following:

 1. Ignore Constant Factors

Under Big O analysis the dominant terms take precedence since constant values affect execution time at nearly the same rate.

Example:

Since we ignore constants during big O analysis the term \(O(2n)\) reduces to \(O(n)\).
